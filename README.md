## Overview
Welcome to the Data Science Capstone Project, the culminating effort of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification. This project centers around the task of predicting the price of each SpaceX launch and determining the likelihood of reusing the first stage. The objective is achieved through a combination of data gathering, exploration, and the application of machine learning techniques. The end result is a comprehensive demonstration of the data science workflow, from initial data exploration and cleaning to the development and evaluation of predictive models.

## Project Goals
Launch Price Prediction: The primary objective is to determine the optimal pricing for each SpaceX launch. This involves in-depth analysis of relevant data to identify key factors influencing launch costs.

## First Stage Reusability Prediction: 
Rather than relying on traditional rocket science methodologies, this project leverages the power data collection and machine learning to predict the successful reusability of the first stage. By utilizing publicly available information, the model aims to forecast whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## Implementation
The project is implemented using Jupyter notebooks, each meticulously detailing the tasks undertaken throughout the data science lifecycle. From data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, each notebook provides transparency into the decision-making process.
